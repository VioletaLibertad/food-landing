# Food Landing

This project was created as a technical challenge in order to apply to the Front End Developer position in Meat. 

The objective was to create a Landing page following the guidelines in [this](https://bit.ly/2YTl3bV) design.

This project was very entertaining to work with, because the majority of the work that I have done lately was related with JavaScript, so I realised I was a little rusty with CSS. I know that the result can be perfected in many ways, in order to achieve pixel perfect in relation with the original desing, but I'm happy with how it ended up. I wish I had more time to work also on the responsive version, but I guess that will come in the future. 

## How to use it

You have to first clone this proyect, and then run:

```
yarn install
```

and later...

```
yarn start
```

The App will be running on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/)

Additionally, you can check on the deployed version [here](https://violetalibertad.github.io/food-landing/)
